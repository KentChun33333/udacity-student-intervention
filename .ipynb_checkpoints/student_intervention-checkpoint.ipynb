    "## 5. Choosing the Best Model\n",
    "\n",
    "- Based on the experiments you performed earlier, in 1-2 paragraphs explain to the board of supervisors what single model you chose as the best model. Which model is generally the most appropriate based on the available data, limited resources, cost, and performance?\n",
    "\n",
    "> In the comparison process I evaluated 3 common classifier algorithms (KNN, Decision Tree, and Naive Bayes) over the sample dataset.  Of the three, one stood out as a relatively inferior fit; the Decision Tree algorithm, even when provided with the maximum training dataset, still could only barely surpass an F1 score of 0.7 while the other 2 algorithms were in the 0.75 range.  This means that either KNN or Naive Bayes would provide comparable accuracy based on my experiments.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Accuracy, however, is not the only concern at play.  Based on Board's expressed preference for a cost-concious model, I think that Naive Bayes will provide a marginally better long term cost if the usage pattern is balanced the way I suspect (infrequent infusions of additional training data, frequent prediction requests).  The KNN algorithm requires keeping all the original data around and comparing new data points to all the known data.  This means training the algorithm takes very little time, but predicting new labels takes significant time per-prediction, and this time (and therefore possible throughput for a given set of resouces and overall spend on compute power) goes up as the amount of training data goes up.  Conversely training the Naive Bayes algorithm is more expensive up front, but far cheaper in terms of marginal cost per prediction.  Given that they provide similar accuracy, Naive Bayes provides similar value for lower resource spend.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In 1-2 paragraphs explain to the board of supervisors in layman's terms how the final model chosen is supposed to work (for example if you chose a Decision Tree or Support Vector Machine, how does it make a prediction).\n",
    "\n",
    "> Any description of a technical topic to a non-technical audience is likely to be fraught with poor assumptions about the transparency of given jargon and the struggle to find the appropriate level of abstraction to gain the necessary intuition for a given solution.  With this in mind I'll try to write simply to minimize poor assumptions on my part about any particular piece of foundational knowledge: The model selected from the experiment so far is known as a Naive Bayes Classifier.  It's \"naive\"-ness of name seems to make one suspicious about how useful it could possibly be, but because the way in which it is naive is related to a bit of statistical knowledge about relationships, we should perhaps leave out the idea that the classifier itself is any more naive than any other computer program about the real world data it's dealing with.  Instead let's focus on how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Imagine a bag of balls, some red some green.  If you know in advance that there are 80 green and 20 red, than you have some information to go off of already for making predictions about what the color of any new ball will be that gets added to the set and it's already better than chance.  Now imagine that you have a few other pieces of data for all the existing balls: how dense they are, diameter, how rigid or squishy.  Given a new ball (without being able to see it's color), you could use what you know about the distribution of each of these bits of information across all balls in the bag, and use it to make a sort of probability for how likely that ball is to be red and how likely it is to be green.  This is a reasonable abstraction for how naive bayes works.  It asks the question \"Assuming that this new ball is Red, what is the probability that it would be 2oz and very squishy and 3 inches across? Assuming it's green, what is the probability that it would be 2oz and very squishy and 3 inches across?\".  The higher of the two probabilities (which are combined with a knowledge of the _prior_ probability of how likey any particular ball is to be red or green given the overall color distribution) is how it decides which way to classify a new ball.  For our student intervention system, the color of the ball is whether the student is likely to pass or fail, and the things we know are bits of data about their demographic, habits, and health rather than physical characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fine-tune the model. Use Gridsearch with at least one important parameter tuned and with at least 3 settings. Use the entire training set for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Note: I couldn't find any useful parameters to tune for GaussianNB, so to prove I knew the material I ran the GridSearch process on the DecisionTreeClassifier instead.\n",
